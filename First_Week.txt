I learned a lot of things this week which suprised me. The first day coming in here, I thought that this course was gonna be very wretched, bland, and maybe it wasn't for me. Then when Carlos came and started presenting I became much more interested. During this week, I learnd about the different types of gates, the four basic functions of a computer, how to use the command line and different commands in it, and many more. My favorite part about his week was being able to meet new people and learning.
